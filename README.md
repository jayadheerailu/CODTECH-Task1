key points:

Entity Declaration: Defines the SPI Master entity with ports for clock, reset, enable, clock polarity, clock phase, MISO, SCLK, SS_N, MOSI, busy, TX, and RX.

Generic Parameter: Specifies the data length in bits (default 16).

Signal Declarations: Defines internal signals for FSM state, receive/transmit mode, clock toggle counter, last bit indicator, receive/transmit buffers, and internal SS_N/SCLK signals.

Finite State Machine (FSM): Implements two states - init (idle) and execute (communication).

SPI Master Protocol:

Initiates communication on enable.

Sets clock polarity and phase.

Transmits and receives data.

Toggles SCLK and SS_N signals.

Clock Toggle Counter: Tracks clock cycles.

Receive/Transmit Mode: Switches between transmit and receive modes.

Internal Registers: Holds data to be transmitted (txBuffer) and received data (rxBuffer).

Output Signals: Drives SS_N, SCLK, MOSI, and busy signals.

Process Statements:

Resets FSM and signals on reset.

Initiates communication on enable.

Implements SPI master protocol.
